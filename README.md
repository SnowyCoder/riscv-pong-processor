# Pong RISCV
A (very) simple 32-bit RISCV processor with a loaded Pong game to show it off
![Video of processor in function](pong_riscv.gif)

This has been done for the exam "Architettura dei Calcolatori" at UniMoRe.

### Notes
Even if the GIF is slowed down the circuit isn't optimized, and it seems to run
 at ~100Hz on my computer.

To create the code to load in the logisim ROM you can use the script `compile_program.sh`, you need to have
[RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) installed for it to work.
